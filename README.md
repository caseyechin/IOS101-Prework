Some Ideas to improve the app :

- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Iplement a way to change the color of the text as well


App Brainstorming


Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps

 - Capital One App
    - The UI of the home screen, how it cleanly displays different accounts while still allowing some customization from the user.
    - Renaming of accounts, while still displaying original account information.
  
 - Spotify App
     - Swipe through playlist previews, showing snippets of each song.
     - Spotify blend, to make playlists with friends that merge everyones song tastes.
     - Saves all bluetooth deivces which makes it really easy to switch between different ones.

 - Apple Wallet
      - Easily switch the Main card in the wallet by switching the order of the cards shown in the app
      - Keeps debit / credit cardws separate from insurance and points cards.
      - Can easily look through past transactions and certain card information through the card displays.
 

Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

 - I would want to create some kind of improved calendar app, that i could design so it catered a little better to me as a student who likes to record many different kinds of events, and give many different statuses to them. Specifically, I would want to make a calendar app that could make both creating events (mainly classes) and sorting through different events in calendars a little bit easier, so I can keep better track of more optional events like office hours and on campus events I may or may not want to attend in the future. Also, I would want to make an app that is more aesthetic than I think any of the other calendar apps I've used are.
